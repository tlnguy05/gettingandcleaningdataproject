This reposiotry is the submission for the Getting And Cleaning Data Peer Assignment week 4 on Coursera instructed by Johns Hopkins University. It includes a **CodeBook.MD** file where you can find the data set description, a **README.MD** file that you are reading now, a R scipt **run_analysis.R** that you will run to get the tidy data set as described in the Codebook and a text file **tidydata.txt** that stores our tidy data set.
